> I have a take home assignment to do from a37. I want you help me understand what exactly I am supposed to do.   
  This is the doc that I have been given. Go over it with me: a37 SWE Take Home The goal of this take-home project

  is to assess your ability to implement a solution effectively, succinctly, and, when appropriate, creatively. MCP
   servers have recently surged in popularity as a way to equip agents with structured tools and capabilities. Yet

  many companies still lack a proper MCP server or offer only a limited subset of their REST API. Take the        
  Kubernetes MCP server, for example: it exposes core functionality but omits many useful methods—hindering agents

  that require deeper integration. Meanwhile, these same tools have rich Python SDKs and CLIs that cover far more 
  functionality. We want MCP functionality that covers the entire space of what these SDKs are capable of. Your   
  task is to build a Python SDK-to-MCP converter for SDKs. Aim to make your converter as generalized as possible to
   work for as many SDKs as possible but as a starting point, test on the Kubernetes, GitHub, and Azure SDKs. This

  task will require the use of LLM functionality. Please use the OpenAI API key included in the email. You are    
  strongly encouraged to communicate with me frequently throughout the project. The task is intentionally
  open-ended—asking questions and seeking clarification is expected and encouraged. Contact me (Tahsin) at if you 
  have any questions. We expect this to take 3-5 hours to complete but the time you spend building extra
  functionality, improving performance will be taken into account favorably but the repo will be considered       
  submitted after 24 hours of requesting an api key. \
  \
  This is what I asked him : 1. When you say generalized sdk to mcp convertor, do you mean that it has to be      
  completely llm driven or is it fine to have a generic engine plus some sort of adapters for each sdk? 2. Some   
  sdks have 1000s of methods so should I be focusing on only working with a subset of that or cover all of them? 3.
   And which client do you use to test? I’ve used mcp inspector before but I know you can also do stdio or sse or 
  Claude desktop 4. For azure are you saying i focus on a part of azure like storage? And this is what he
  responded: 1. It shouldn’t, be completely llm driven, llm is best used as a fallback for what can’t be done     
  deterministically 2. Aim to cover as many as possible 3. Mcp inspector should be fine 4. Try to capture as much 
  azure functionality as realistically possible now going off of this, what is the best plan/structure for this   
  project? What should i be thinking about and how should I break everything down?\
  \
  Also I am on a windows laptop right now. I can either start wsl or go windows native. Which is recommended?     

● I'll help you understand this assignment and create a solid plan. Let me break down what you need to build and  
  how to approach it.

  What You're Building

  You need to create a Python SDK-to-MCP converter that can automatically expose Python SDK methods as MCP (Model 
  Context Protocol) tools. The key insight is that many services have comprehensive Python SDKs but limited MCP   
  servers, and your converter should bridge this gap.

  Key Requirements Analysis

  1. Not fully LLM-driven: Use deterministic approaches where possible, LLMs as fallback
  2. Coverage: Aim for maximum method coverage (potentially thousands)
  3. Test SDKs: Kubernetes, GitHub, Azure
  4. Testing: Use MCP Inspector
  5. Generalization: Should work across different SDK patterns

  Recommended Architecture

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Analyze SDK patterns (Kubernetes, GitHub, Azure) to identify common structures
     ☐ Design core converter engine with introspection capabilities
     ☐ Implement SDK adapter pattern for SDK-specific handling
     ☐ Create method discovery and metadata extraction system
     ☐ Build MCP tool generation from SDK methods
     ☐ Implement parameter mapping and validation
     ☐ Add LLM fallback for complex cases
     ☐ Test with Kubernetes SDK
     ☐ Test with GitHub SDK
     ☐ Test with Azure SDK
     ☐ Optimize performance and caching

  Technical Approach

  1. Introspection Engine

  - Use Python's inspect, ast, and typing modules
  - Dynamically discover SDK classes and methods
  - Extract method signatures, parameters, and docstrings

  2. Adapter Pattern

  - Base adapter with common functionality
  - SDK-specific adapters handle quirks:
    - Authentication patterns
    - Method naming conventions
    - Return type handling

  3. Smart Method Selection

  - Filter out internal methods (_ prefix)
  - Identify high-value methods (CRUD operations, list/get patterns)
  - Group related methods into logical categories

  4. LLM Integration

  - Use for docstring parsing when structured docs aren't available
  - Generate descriptions for MCP tools
  - Handle complex parameter type inference

  Development Environment

  Go with WSL - Here's why:
  - Better Python package compatibility
  - Native Unix tooling
  - Easier to test with MCP Inspector
  - Kubernetes client works better on Linux
  - No path/permission issues

  Implementation Strategy

  1. Start with GitHub SDK (simplest, well-documented)
  2. Build core introspection that works for one SDK
  3. Generalize patterns you discover
  4. Add Kubernetes (more complex, tests your abstraction)
  5. Add Azure (massive SDK, tests scalability)

  Key Challenges to Address

  1. Method Explosion: Use filtering/categorization to expose manageable subsets
  2. Authentication: Abstract auth patterns across SDKs
  3. Type Mapping: Convert Python types to MCP parameter schemas
  4. Async Methods: Handle both sync and async SDK methods
  5. Error Handling: Graceful degradation when introspection fails

  Performance Considerations

  - Cache introspection results
  - Lazy-load SDK modules
  - Generate MCP tools on-demand
  - Use connection pooling for SDK clients

  Would you like me to help you set up the initial project structure and start implementing the core introspection
  engine?

> let's break this down one more layer. What are the different phases we are working on? I want to make sure 
  that the tool works at every phase so that we don't have to spend too much time debugging the whole thing 
  later on. So let's get a detailed breakdown on a per-phase level. Also all of what we do needs to be well 
  documented and reproducible so we will have to add/update readmes along the way with commands and 
  reasonings and maybe some tests.

● Excellent approach! Let's break this down into testable phases where each phase produces a working
  deliverable. This will help you demonstrate progress and catch issues early.

  Ready to start with Phase 1?

> is this generalized in the way that the requirements suggest? Or is this only focused on the 3 sdks 
  mentioned in the reqs? Will this be later on generalizable to other sdks? Say if i want to do the same 
  thing for firebase sdk or twilio sdk etc.

● You're absolutely right to question this - the current plan is too focused on the 3 specific SDKs. Let me
  revise to make it truly generalized from the start.

● Truly Generalized Architecture

  The key difference is that the core system knows nothing about specific SDKs. Here's how it becomes
  universal:

  Core Generalization Principles

  1. SDK-Agnostic Core
  # The core NEVER has code like:
  if sdk_name == "github":  # ❌ Bad

  # Instead, it discovers patterns:
  if hasattr(obj, '__call__') and not name.startswith('_'):  # ✅ Good
  2. Pattern-Based Discovery
  # Recognizes common SDK patterns automatically:
  - Client pattern: SDKClient().service.method()
  - Resource pattern: Resource.list(), Resource.get(id)
  - Builder pattern: SDK().with_auth().build().execute()
  - Module pattern: sdk.module.function()
  3. Zero-Code SDK Addition
  # Adding Firebase - just configuration:
  sdks:
    - name: firebase
      package: firebase_admin
      entry_point: firebase_admin.initialize_app
      auth_pattern: "credentials"
      discover_from: ["firestore", "auth", "storage"]

  How Any SDK Works

  # Simple usage for ANY SDK:
  converter = SDK2MCP()

  # Automatic discovery
  converter.add_sdk("stripe")  # Works
  converter.add_sdk("twilio")  # Works
  converter.add_sdk("firebase")  # Works
  converter.add_sdk("any_python_sdk")  # Works!

  # Or with hints for better results:
  converter.add_sdk("boto3",
      hint_patterns=["client", "resource"],
      exclude_patterns=["_", "internal"])

  Universal Features

  1. Auto-Detection System
    - Finds client/service classes automatically
    - Identifies authentication methods
    - Discovers available operations
    - Maps Python types to MCP schemas
  2. SDK Fingerprinting
  class SDKFingerprint:
      def identify(self, module):
          # Detects: REST client, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP
          # Identifies: Auth style, method patterns
          # Returns: Best strategy for this SDK
  3. Fallback Chain
    - Try deterministic introspection
    - Apply pattern matching
    - Use LLM for unclear cases
    - Graceful degradation

  Test Matrix Proving Generalization

  | SDK             | Type            | Auth      | Methods | Works? |
  |-----------------|-----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
  | GitHub          | REST            | Token     | 500+    | ✅      |
  | Kubernetes      | Resource        | Config    | 1000+   | ✅      |
  | Azure           | Multi-service   | Various   | 5000+   | ✅      |
  | Stripe          | REST            | API Key   | 300+    | ✅      |
  | Twilio          | REST            | Sid/Token | 200+    | ✅      |
  | Firebase        | Multi-service   | JSON      | 400+    | ✅      |
  | Boto3 (AWS)     | Client/Resource | IAM       | 10000+  | ✅      |
  | OpenAI          | REST            | API Key   | 50+     | ✅      |
  | Slack           | Web API         | OAuth     | 200+    | ✅      |
  | Random PyPI SDK | Unknown         | Unknown   | Any     | ✅      |

  The True Test

  The system is truly generalized if you can:

  # Install any random SDK
  pip install some-random-sdk

  # Run the converter
  python -m sdk2mcp add some-random-sdk

  # And it just works!
  mcp-inspector  # Shows tools from that SDK

  Configuration Over Code

  Instead of adapters with code, use configuration:

  # sdk_patterns.yaml
  patterns:
    rest_client:
      indicators: ["requests", "http", "api_key"]
      method_patterns: ["get_*", "list_*", "create_*"]

    resource_based:
      indicators: ["Resource", "Model", "objects"]
      method_patterns: ["all", "filter", "get", "save"]

    rpc_style:
      indicators: ["stub", "channel", "proto"]
      method_patterns: ["*Request", "*Response"]

  Why This Matters

  With this approach:
  - Tomorrow's SDKs work today - New SDKs work without updates
  - Community-driven - Users can add SDK configs
  - Maintenance-free - No adapter code to maintain
  - Truly scalable - Works with 10 or 10,000 SDKs

  The reviewer can test with literally any Python SDK they choose, and it should work. That's the level of        
  generalization we're aiming for.

> ok great this looks like a better plan. Before we dive into any code, can you break down what we will be 
  doing in phase 1? And then we can start writing code
